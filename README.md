# RSET-file-manager
In a world of large amount of data being generated in different departments of an institution, it is of prime importance to establish an effective storage management system ensuring proper  communication and collaboration between different departments  of the same institution . The objective of this project was to design a file sharing system where users can upload files and other users can download them. The RSET File Manager is a file server prototype built in Node.js(Node file manager and cloud cmd) which has got a single admin interface and all the file system capabilities. The software enables the users to share the files between departments without handling it physically. The Admin  user name and password will be initialized during the installation process. The security of the file management system is ensured this way.Also authorization is required in the case of editing a particular file.  A user can upload files and folders from his or her system, any social networking apps as well as external links. The System can be used to send and receive research files and helps in sharing training materials, project related items and helps efficiently connects the faculties and students around various departments. Also the reliability factor is improved as the information is not susceptible to physical damage.
